Advent of Code is a free, annual [online event](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) that challenges participants to solve Christmas-themed programming puzzles. 
The puzzles are released daily from December 1st to 25th, and participants can use any programming language they like to solve them. 

These solutions were originally created by [Mark Street](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkst) 

The more complete source code is available at https://github.com/mkst/aoc.
